# 3: Design a Python application that creates two threads named EvenList and OddList.

# Both threads should accept a list of integers as input.

# The EvenList thread should:
# Extract all even elements from the list.
# Calculate and display their sum.

# The OddList thread should:
# Extract all odd elements from the list.
# Calculate and display their sum.

# Threads should run concurrently.
